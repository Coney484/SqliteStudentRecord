# SqliteStudentRecord
  This is project is based on concept of CRUD i.e Create, Read, Update, Delete. It deals with a simple Student Record DataBase which uses
  SQLite Database for CRUD operations.

# Motivation
  The motivation behind this project was that to apply the concept of SQLite which I learned as theory and then implement it with an Android
  Application which helped me to understand SQLite practically.
